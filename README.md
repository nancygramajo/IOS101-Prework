## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Some of my favorite applications are Youtube, Twitch, Tiktok, and Spotify.
Favorite features
  Youtube - the recommended videos on the homepage, being able to exit the app and still have the video play
  Twitch - points for watch time, emotes/comments 
  Tiktok - filters, fast forwarding
  Spotify - Dj, Radio playlists

An app I would like to work on is Tiktok. I have found that the algorithm on Tiktok is very influenced by the videos I choose to search for or like. 
I would like to change this so that I don't get multiple videos on the same topic back to back. I would really like to see Tiktok's alogirthm change
so that users are receiving different kinds of content, not just content based on the most recent videos they've watched and liked. Another app I
would like to work on is Spotify. I really like the new Dj feature. But one thing I would like to see Spotify implement is the option for a user to
select how long they would like each segment of the Dj set to be. I have found that the Dj will change the music genres more often than I would prefer. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
